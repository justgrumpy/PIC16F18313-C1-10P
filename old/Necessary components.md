### Necessary components

*   **7.4V LiPo Battery:** This will power your entire system. A 2S LiPo battery is a good choice.
*   **7.4V High Voltage (HV) Servos:** If your servos are already rated for 7.4V, you can skip the second regulator.
*   **Switching Voltage Regulator (UBEC):** A BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit) is a type of switching voltage regulator commonly used in RC applications. You need one that can convert 7.4V (up to 8.4V when fully charged) to a stable 5V output.
    *   **Capacity:** Ensure the UBEC has enough current capacity for the Flysky receiver, PIC, and DFPlayer Pro. These are typically low-current devices, so a UBEC rated for at least 3A should be sufficient.
*   **Wiring:** Use appropriate gauge wire for connecting the battery to the regulator and components.

### Wiring instructions
1.  **Connect the Battery to the Regulator:** Connect the positive ($+$) and negative ($-$) terminals of the 7.4V battery to the input of the switching voltage regulator.
2.  **Connect Servos:** Connect the positive ($+$) and negative ($-$) terminals of the battery directly to the power inputs of your HV servos. All components must share a common ground.
3.  **Connect 5V Components to the Regulator Output:**
    *   Connect the output of the voltage regulator to the power inputs of the Flysky receiver, the PIC16F18313, and the DFPlayer Pro.
    *   **Ground:** Ensure all components share a common ground by connecting all their ground pins together.
4.  **Connect Signal and Data Lines:**
    *   **Flysky to PIC:** Connect the receiver's PWM or i-BUS output channels to the PIC's input pins.
    *   **PIC to DFPlayer Pro:** Connect the PIC's UART pins to the DFPlayer Pro's RX/TX pins.
    *   **PIC to Servos:** Connect the PIC's output pins to the signal inputs of the servos.

### Important safety considerations
*   **Check servo rating:** Before connecting the servos, double-check that they are rated for high voltage operation. Powering a standard servo with 7.4V will cause it to overheat and fail.
*   **Common Ground:** To prevent issues, ensure all components share a single common ground connection.
*   **Current Draw:** Verify that the chosen UBEC can handle the total current draw of your 5V components. While the PIC and DFPlayer are low power, they add to the load.
*   **Insulate Connections:** Use heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to insulate all connections and prevent short circuits.
